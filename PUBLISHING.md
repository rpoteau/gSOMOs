# üì¶ Publishing SOMOs on PyPI

This memo summarizes all the steps to build and publish the `SOMOs` package.

---

## üîß Setup (one-time)

activate your python environment, if relevant

```bash
pip install build twine
```

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Create a PyPI or TestPyPI account

If you haven‚Äôt already, create an account on:

- [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/)
- [Real PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/)

Then log in.

------------

## ü™™ Create a PyPI or TestPyPI API token

To avoid using your real password when uploading, create a secure API token:

- Go to your **Account Settings ‚Üí API tokens**
- Click **"Add API token"**
- Choose a name and a scope (entire account or a specific project)
- Copy the generated token (it starts with `pypi-...`) ‚Äî you‚Äôll only see it once!

- [TestPyPI token management](https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens)
- [PyPI token management](https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens)

---

## üîê Optional: Save your token in a `.pypirc` file

Create a file named `.pypirc` in your home directory (`~/.pypirc`):

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = pypi-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

[testpypi]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = pypi-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

This avoids typing the token every time you use `twine upload`.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Build the package

Run from the project root (where `pyproject.toml` is):

```bash
rm -rf dist/ build/ SOMOs.egg-info/ # unless it is the first time you try to build the package
python -m build
```

This creates a `dist/` folder with:
- `somos-x.y.z.tar.gz` (source)
- `somos-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel)

Don't forget to update the version number in `pyproject.toml`

---

## üì§ Upload to TestPyPI (sandbox)

```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Then install from TestPyPI to test:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple SOMOs
```

---

## üì§ Upload to real PyPI

Once you're confident with TestPyPI:

```bash
twine upload dist/*
```

---

## üßº Clean up build files (recommended)

```bash
rm -rf build dist SOMOs.egg-info
```

---


## ‚úÖ Install your package locally (editable mode)

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Then in Python:

```python
from somos import io, cosim, proj
```

---


## üöÄ Fast process

```bash
rm -rf build dist SOMOs.egg-info
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
pip install -e .
```

<hr style="height:3px; background-color:#00aaaa; border:none;" />


# üß† What is `pip install -e .` (Editable Install)?

This part explains **what `pip install -e .` does**, why it‚Äôs useful, and how it applies to your project `SOMOs`.

---

## üì¶ What does it do?

```bash
pip install -e .
```

means:

> "Tell Python to install this package **in editable mode** ‚Äî don‚Äôt copy the code, just link to it so any changes I make to the source code take effect immediately."

This is also called **"develop mode"** or **"symlink install"**.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder structure required

You must run the command in the folder where your `pyproject.toml` is located, and this file must define the name of your package:

```
~/projects/SOMOS-4pyPi/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml              üëà defines `project.name = "SOMOs"`
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ somos/                      üëà your actual package code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ io.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cosim.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ proj.py
```

---

## ‚úÖ What happens when you run it

In your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/projects/SOMOS-4pyPi
pip install -e .
```

Python:
- Reads `pyproject.toml`
- Sees `name = "SOMOs"`
- Registers a **symlink** to `somos/` in your Python environment
- So when you do `from somos import io`, it looks in this folder

You should see:

```
Successfully built SOMOs
Successfully installed SOMOs
```

If you see:

```
Found existing installation: SOMOs x.y.z
Can't uninstall 'SOMOs'. No files were found to uninstall.
```

That‚Äôs just a harmless notice: it means the package was previously installed in editable mode and there‚Äôs nothing to uninstall. Your new editable install **still works**.

---

## üß™ Why is this useful?

Because if you edit any `.py` file (e.g. `cosim.py`), you don‚Äôt need to reinstall your package ‚Äî the changes take effect immediately.

Perfect for development, notebooks, or live testing.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Does it overwrite anything?

**No. Nothing is copied or erased.**  
It just tells your Python environment:

> "If someone does `import somos`, use this exact local folder right here."

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Where does it install?

To see what it actually does, run:

```bash
pip show SOMOs
```

This will show you the linked path and confirm it's using your local files.

---

## ‚úÖ Example usage in notebook

Once installed:

```python
from somos import io, cosim, proj
```

Now modify any file in `somos/`, save it, and your notebook will reflect the change immediately!

# üìÑ Managing `.gitignore` and `MANIFEST.in`

When preparing your package for PyPI, you must control which files are:

- Included inside your distribution archive (`.tar.gz`, `.whl`)
- Ignored from Git versioning

---

## üßπ `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file tells Git **what NOT to track** in your repository.

Typical entries:

```bash
# Python. Ignore temporary files and builds
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.so
*.pyd
*.egg-info/
.eggs/
build/
!docs/build/
dist/
# *.log

# Jupyter notebooks
.ipynb_checkpoints/
*.ipynb~

# VSCode / IDEs
.vscode/
.idea/

# Ignore sphinx / mkdocs builds
_site/
docs/_build/

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Custom project
*.xlsx
*.png
!*-C.png
*.pdf
!doc-latex/*.pdf
!docs/source/_static/*.pdf

# Swap and temporary
*~
*.swp
*.swo


```

‚úÖ It keeps your GitHub repo **clean and lightweight**.

---

## üì¶ `MANIFEST.in`

The `MANIFEST.in` file tells setuptools **what TO INCLUDE** in the distribution archive.

Example:

```bash
include README.md
include CHANGELOG.md
include pyproject.toml
include MANIFEST.in

# Include everything inside docs and doc-latex
recursive-include docs *
recursive-include doc-latex *

# Include all source code inside somos
recursive-include somos *

# Include example notebooks
include *.ipynb

# Include md files
include *.md

# Include log folder
recursive-include logs *
```

‚úÖ It ensures that:
- Your code
- Your documentation files (PDFs, banners, etc.)
- Your `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `pyproject.toml`
  
are all packed into your `.tar.gz` or `.whl` files.

---

## üß† Important

- **Git and PyPI are independent**:  
  What you push to GitHub (controlled by `.gitignore`) is not exactly what you upload to PyPI (controlled by `MANIFEST.in`).
  
- **You can ignore a file in Git but still include it in your PyPI package** (and vice-versa).

- **Missing MANIFEST entries** will cause your PyPI package to lack essential files (like images, PDFs, etc.)

---

## ‚úÖ Best practices for gSOMOs

- Have a clean `.gitignore` excluding build artifacts
- Explicitly include your important docs/assets in `MANIFEST.in`
- Always rebuild (`python -m build`) and check the content of `dist/*.tar.gz` before uploading
